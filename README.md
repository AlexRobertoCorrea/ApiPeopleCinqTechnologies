# ApiPeopleCinqTechnologies

This is the version 1.0 of Api People Cinq Technologies made by Alex Roberto CorrÃªa. This api allows you create, list, show, 
update and delete people and it is useful when we're using [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) or a script itself.

## Getting Started

To use Api People Cinq Technologies, you'll need:

- Download the package that can be done `git clone https://github.com/AlexRobertoCorrea/ApiPeopleCinqTechnologies.git`
- Install [MongoDB](https://docs.mongodb.org/manual/installation/) and [NodeJS version 0.12.7](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v0.12.7/)  
- Use the command line (if you are using GNU/Linux) `cd ApiPeopleCinqTechnologies`
- Install the dependences: `npm install`
- Start using the api with `node server.js`

It is possible access the api via website. So, you need run:

From here, you have two options: run `node server.js` and access `http://localhost:3002/` or you can run
a fast version doing `grunt serve:dist` and access `http://localhost:3000/`.

The site's home screen is a people list, which you can click on "Create person," click on "Edit" or "Delete". 
In the creation / update person screen is where you enter the data and save.
